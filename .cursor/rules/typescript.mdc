# TypeScript

- Use **strict** TypeScript; no `any` unless strictly necessary and commented.
- **Explicit return types** for all exported functions and hooks.
- Prefer **interface** for public contracts (props, API response shapes); use `type` for unions or mapped types.
- Type API responses and hook return values; avoid untyped `fetch` or `data as T` without validation.
- Use `unknown` in catch blocks; narrow or log before use.
