# React and Components

## Component Rules

- Use **functional components** only.
- **One component per file**; named export matching file name (e.g. `EventList` in `EventList.tsx`).
- Prefer **composition** over large single components; extract subcomponents or hooks when logic grows.
- Use **shadcn/ui** for UI primitives; import from `@/components/ui` (e.g. `Button`, `Card`, `Dialog`). Do not reinvent components that shadcn provides.
- Use **Tailwind** for layout and overrides; avoid inline styles except for truly dynamic values (e.g. width from props).

## Structure

- Props: define an `interface` for component props.
- Keep components focused; move data fetching to hooks (TanStack Query) and keep components presentational where possible.
